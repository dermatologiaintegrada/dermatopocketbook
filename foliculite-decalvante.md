## ***Foliculite Decalvante***


- Usar antibi√≥ticos e em casos resistentes dapsona (Dr Sampaio dermlist de 1/3/07)  
- (Ann Dermatol Venereol 2004 Feb;131(2):195-7) The patients were treated with dapsone at a daily dose of 75 and 100 mg, respectively for 4 to 6 months. After 1 and 2 months, pustular folliculitis progressively cleared, leaving a residual non inflammatory cicatricial alopecia. When maintaining a dapsone dosage at 25 mg/day no relapse occurred during 3 years and 1 year, respectively. No important adverse effect to dapsone was evidenced. After dapsone withdrawal, a moderate relapse of the disease with pruritus and folliculitis occurred after a few weeks in both cases. The disease relapse rapidly cleared after dapsone reintroduction at a daily dose of 25 mg. COMMENTS: Dapsone at moderate dosage was well tolerated and rapidly effective in treating the two cases of folliculitis decalvans. A long term and low dose (25 mg daily) maintenance treatment avoided disease relapses.
